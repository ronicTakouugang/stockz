# Stock Analysis and Prediction App

## About This Project

This project is a full-stack stock analysis and prediction application. The frontend is built with Next.js and the backend is a Python FastAPI service. The application provides a dashboard with stock market data from TradingView widgets. It also offers detailed analysis of individual stocks, which is generated by a combination of a Python backend (for predictions, sentiment analysis, and backtesting) and Google's Gemini AI (for synthesizing the data and providing a final recommendation). The application also includes user authentication and the ability to create watchlists.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Backend

To run the backend, first install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Then, run the backend server:

```bash
./start_backend.sh
```
